front-end-assignment

Here's my front-end-assignment slot machine. 

I added some elements to the assignment.
- I made the preloader screen slower because we couldn't see the loading build up to 100% because it's too fast.
- I added a yellow background to winning sprites. It makes it easier to see the results.
- I added a minify version of the JS for performance.

Note: 
- I did this on a localhost server environnement (XAMPP v.3.3.0) to prevent CORS policy from blocking Sprite images.
- I used PIXI 6.5.2 since there was no specific version mention and also because we are using ES6.

Thank you
